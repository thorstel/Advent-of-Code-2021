# Advent of Code 2021
My puzzle solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

## Build & Run
My C++ solutions rely on `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`, no additional third-party libraries required. I am using the following compiler flags:
```
$ g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -O2 -std=c++17 dayXX.cc
```

For my Python solutions I use Python 3.9.

All my solutions are self-contained programs. I copy + paste my inputs directly into the source files. Different inputs can be used by passing a file path via command line argument.
